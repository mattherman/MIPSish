# MIPS-ish

A C# program written using `goto` and the new [top-level statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements) introduced in C# 9 in order to approximate the look and feel of a MIPS assembly program in a much higher-level language. Not meant to be serious, simply a fun way to twist the language into something it was never meant to be.

The Fibonacci program source was adapted from [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence#MIPS_Assembly).
